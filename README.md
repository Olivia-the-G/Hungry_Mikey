## Description 
Hungry Mikey is an **interactive game for children ages (age range here)** that helps them to learn about nutritional values and eating a balanced diet. 

Using this game, kids will be able to choose from some options what they would like Mikey to eat, and then receive **adaptive feedback based on their choices**. 

This feedback is **powered by AI** in order to provide new reactions every time. 

Hungry Mikey makes use of characters from the **Disney short film "Steamboat Willie"** which was just recently added to the public domain, allowing anyone to freely use the likeness of all the characters found in the film.
